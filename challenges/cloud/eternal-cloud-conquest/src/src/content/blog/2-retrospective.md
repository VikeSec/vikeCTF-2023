# Introduction

Greetings, fellow warriors and battleaxe enthusiasts! I am Erik the Wise, one of the co-founders of Viking Axe Co, and I would like to share with you a cautionary tale about the importance of cybersecurity, and the steps we have taken to ensure the security of our website.

## Our wrong doing

When we first launched Viking Axe Co, we utilized a legacy cloud static website to store our battle-axes. At the time, we believed that this was a secure solution, and that our axes were safe from harm. Unfortunately, we were wrong. Our website was hacked, and our precious battle-axes were stolen. It was a devastating blow, and it made us realize the importance of cybersecurity in the modern age.

## Solution

We knew that we needed to take action to secure our website and protect our customers' axes. And so, we turned to AWS for a solution. We built a new EC2 server, and implemented a series of security measures designed to prevent any unauthorized access or attacks. We configured the external network access to not allow anyone to access restricted resources.

But our work did not stop there. We continually monitor our server for any signs of suspicious activity, and regularly update our security protocols to ensure that we stay ahead of any potential threats.

## Stay with us

We understand the trust that our customers place in us, and we take that responsibility very seriously. Furthermore, we want you to know that we have done everything in our power to ensure the security of our website, and that your battle-axes are safe and secure with us.

So rest assured, fellow warriors, that your battle-axes are in good hands with Viking Axe Co. We stand behind the security of our website, and will continue to do everything in our power to protect your axes from harm.
